## Semantic search using Smooth Inverse Frequency

SIF embeddings (Smooth Inverse Frequency) computes sentence embeddings as a weighted average of word vectors

In short, SIF embeddings can be computed this way:
-First, compute all the frequencies of all the words of your corpus.
-Then, given a hyper-parameter a usually set to 1e-3, and a set of pre-trained word embeddings, compute the weighted average above for each of your texts/sentences.
-Finally, Use SVD to remove the first component off of these averages and get fresh sentence embeddings.
